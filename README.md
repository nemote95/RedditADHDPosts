Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a mental health disorder that can cause above-normal levels of hyperactive and impulsive behaviours. ADHD in women often goes undiagnosed due to many cultural and social issues. To analyse the context of ADHD among female online users, I applied NLP on posts made by women on Reddit about ADHD, collected from Kaggle datasets. My goal for this project is to identify major challenges of ADHD perceived by women. 

Noe: I have not uploaded the dataset since it is a huge file. You can get the data from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/jerseyneo/reddit-adhd-dataset)
